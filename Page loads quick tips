1) Put all javascripts externally, and always load scripts at the end of the page (in footer).
2) Always minify javscripts and css. (meaning, get rid of comments and unused spaces. Basically, everything is all in one line)
5) Host static files like css, javascript and images over different domain. (Ex : static. anything-other-than-gracellemesina.com )
6) Use tools likes firebug & yslow to check the load time (firefox browser).
7) use google's CDN to load JQuery. (Ex: <script src="https://code.jquery.com/jquery-1.12.2.min.js"></script> instead of <script src="js/jquery-1.12.2.min.js"></script>
